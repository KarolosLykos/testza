/*
Package testza is a full-featured testing framework for Go. It integrates with the default test runner, so you can use it with the standard `go test` tool. Testza contains easy to use methods, like assertions, output capturing, mocking, and much more.

Testza is structured a bit differently than you might be used to in Go, but we think that it makes writing tests as easy and efficient as possible.
After all, writing tests should be very simple and should not require you to study a whole framework.
That's why we made testza to integrate perfectly with your IDE. You don't even have to lookup the documentation, as testza is self-explanatory.

Just type `testza.Use.` and you will get a list of all modules of testza in your IDE.
